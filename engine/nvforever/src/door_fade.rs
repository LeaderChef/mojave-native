//! Actors going through a door that leads elsewhere fade out at it and fade in where it
//! leads, as the player's view does (owner's playtest list 5 item 3: "NPCs going
//! through a door should fade out/in and play the door sound, like the player").
//!
//! - **Out**: the drawn body of an actor that used such a door (`residents.rs`, the AI's
//!   `AiEvent::Door`) stands at the door, facing it (`fnv_nav::Walker::face_door`), for
//!   [`FADE_SECONDS`] while it fades out; then it is gone. It does not walk on: carried
//!   along its old heading it slid past the frame of a door it came at from the side
//!   (#1472). It is no longer the actor's body meanwhile (it has
//!   neither `RefVisual` nor `ActorRig`), so nothing else takes it for the actor.
//! - **In**: the actor's body drawn at the other side (when that place is drawn) fades
//!   in over the same time.
//! - **Sound**: the door's open sound (DOOR `SNAM`, as the player's load doors,
//!   `nvf_play::world_sounds`) at the door it went in by and at the one it came out of,
//!   wherever the listener is drawn (`residents.rs` sends `nvf_play::world_sounds::DoorPassed`).
//!
//! The fade is the streamed cells' dither (`fade.rs`): each mesh with a NIF material
//! gets the crossfading visibility range of its step. Bevy picks the dithering pipeline
//! only when a mesh or its material changes, so a mesh given its first range has its
//! material marked changed. Meshes keep the fully drawn range afterwards (fade.rs: one
//! whose range went away would vanish). Meshes of other materials do not fade.
//! [design: how the game fades actors at doors, and for how long, is not documented.]
